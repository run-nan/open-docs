| --------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- |

## Overview

When you want to embed a more independent business function in ONES, you will not interact with the existing pages of ONES. Or when the plugin business you want needs frequent configuration adjustments and needs a convenient entry. You can use this **sidebar menu**. It has a very convenient entrance, in form, it is very similar to an application of ONES, so you can use this ability to handle your independent business.

Plugin that use the **sidebar menu** support installation not only under the team, but also under the organization settings. But when installing in different scenarios, make sure that you create a plugin for the corresponding scenario type.

## Usage

### Step 1: Add ability

1. Select the ability.

   Execute the `npx op add ability` instruction under the root directory of the plugin project, and select: `sidebar-menu@ 1.0.0`.

2. According to the prompt, fill in the name of the associated slot `ones:app:new` and create a submodule.
   :::caution notice
   The slot supports first level submodules, so you must add first level submodules, otherwise it will behave abnormally.
   :::

3. After the execution is completed, the `plugin.yaml` configuration will be automatically updated and a module template file will be generated.

   <Image img={require('../images/add-ability.png')} />

   - A new configuration will be added under the **abilities** attribute. The configuration is as follows:

   ```yaml title="config/plugin.yaml"
   abilities:
     - id: 8k5frAw6
       name: SidebarMenu
       version: 1.0.0
       abilityType: SidebarMenu
       relateModule:
         systemMenu: 'ones-app-new-aBFM'
   ```

   - A new configuration will be added under the **modules** attribute. The configuration is as follows:

   ```yaml title="config/plugin.yaml"
   modules:
     - id: ones-app-new-aBFM
       title: Sidebar Menu Item
       moduleType: ones:app:new
       modules:
         - id: ones-app-new-JusW
           title: Topbar
           entry: modules/ones-app-new-aBFM/ones-app-new-JusW/index.html
   ```

   - The following templates will be added to the `/web/src/modules` directory:

     You can write your plugin logic here. For the specific configuration items supported by this slot, please refer to: [ones:app:new](../slot/app/index.mdx#onesappnew).

### Step 2: Use in ONES

After you have finished writing your plugin, package the plugin and install it into ONES so you can see the performance of this ability. Click enable, and refresh the page after successful enabling. You will see the following figure: the entry of the plugin is added to the left menu bar, and there is also a **Open** button on the details page, which can open the plugin page directly.

:::tip
If you create an organization level plugin, there will be no **Open** button on the plugin details page.

### Step 3: Control the display and hiding

We have built some abilities to control the entry in ONES. First, you need to go to [Configuration]-[System preferences settings]-[Sidebar menu]. You can display the **Display name**, **Display order**, **Display in sidebar** of the plugin entry on this page.

<Image img={require('./images/menu-setting-en.png')} />

### Step 4: Settings

While supporting this ability, we also support the permission configuration of this ability, so you can configure a separate permission point for each new module. In order to make it easier for you to configure permissions, we provide you with a **Settings** button in the top column, which can jump directly to the corresponding plugin details page.

## FAQ

### What if I want to create multiple "Sidebar Menu"?

We specify that a plugin can only define one sidebar menu, and if this limit is exceeded, the plugin will fail with an error. So if you want to define multiple sidebar menu, you have to install multiple plugins.
