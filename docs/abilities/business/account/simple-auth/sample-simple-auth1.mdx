# Scene： Assign employees of the department to make a simple login

## Scene Description

Users want employees of the `Altman` department to log in directly without a password.

## Performance

Users do not need to enter a password, just declare their own department and `user_ uuid` to log in directly.

- Employees whose department is `monster` cannot simply log in.

- Employees whose department is `Altman` successfully log in simply and get access token.

<Image img={sampleSimpleAuth2} />

## Solution

### Implementation idea

Through the simple login ability, when an employee whose department is `Altman` is identified, the origin regular login logic of the ONES system is skipped and the login status of the employee is directly realized by calling the simple login interface of the plugin directly.

### Plugin development

1. Use the OP tool to add simple-auth ability

2. Complete the business logic of the `SimpleAuthValidate` method

```typescript
import type { PluginRequest, PluginResponse } from '@ones-op/node-types'

export async function SimpleAuthValidate(request: PluginRequest): Promise<PluginResponse> {
  const body = request?.body as any
  let user_uuid = body['user_uuid']
  let department = body['department']
  if (!user_uuid) {
    return {
      body: {
        code: 400,
        reason: '缺少参数 user_uuid',
      },
    }
  }
  if (!department) {
    return {
      body: {
        code: 400,
        reason: '缺少参数 department',
      },
    }
  } else if (department != 'Altman') {
    return {
      body: {
        code: 401,
        reason: '该部门不能进行简单登录',
      },
    }
  }
  return {
    body: {
      code: 200,
      data: {
        uuid: user_uuid,
        department: department,
      },
    },
  }
}
```

3. Install and enable the plugin to support simple login for employees of specified departments.
