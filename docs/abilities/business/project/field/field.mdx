# Customize issue fields

In the ONES system, issues, projects, and products come with a set of built-in system fields. However, when these system fields do not fully meet the requirements, ONES also allows users to directly create various custom system fields such as single-select menus, multi-select menus, single-line text, multi-line text, and floating-point numbers.

However, in some scenarios we may have higher customization needs for custom fields, such as:

- for single-select/multi-select menu fields, we want the menu options to synchronize with an external data source.
- for floating-point number fields, we want the property values to be calculated solely by the code and not editable by the user.

To fulfill these requirements, the Open Platform provides the "Script Fields Capability" which allows developers to achieve more flexible custom fields by writing plugins.
