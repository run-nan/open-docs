## Overview

This is a blank module, that runs outside of the system. The build rule of the page's URL is as follows:

```
${location.protocol}://${location.host}/plugin/${organization_id}/${team_id}/${service.app_id}/${service.version}/modules/${module_id}/index.html
```

:::caution

Because this page runs outside of the system, the package [`@ones-op/store`](../../../reference/packages/store/store.md) can't be used.
