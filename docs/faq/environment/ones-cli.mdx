## Windows

### Install node-gyp

In the process of initializing the plugin project, ONES CLI will install the `/backend` of the project depending on it, and the dependent installation exception may occur in the process.

This is usually caused by the lack of tools needed for construction, which requires developers to check and install additional build tools `node-gyp` during the installation of NodeJS.

It should be noted that in some Windows distributions (such as the home version), users are not asked
by default whether they need to use administrator permissions to install NodeJS, while `node-gpy` may
fail due to lack of permissions.

In this case, the developer needs to start `Powershell` or `CMD` with administrator permissions and start the NodeJS installer with the following instructions:

```Powershell
msiexec /package "C:\foo\baz\node-v16.xx.xx-x64.msi"
```

If you are correctly installing `node-gyp`, there are still problems in the process of initializing the plugin project. It is recommended that developers locate, fix, or report the problem from the `npm debug log`.

## MAC/Linux

### Install CMake

In the process of initializing the plugin project, ONES CLI will install the `/backend` of the project depending on it, and the dependent installation exception may occur in the process.

This is because some of the dependencies required for plugin development use the `CMake` tool. Therefore, if the project depends on an exception during the installation process, you need to install the `CMake` tool.

#### Install for `brew`

```bash
brew install cmake
```

#### Install for `dmg`

It is recommended that you install stable version 3.22：[cmake-3.22.2-macos-universal.dmg](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.22.2/cmake-3.22.2-macos-universal.dmg)

After the dmg installation is complete, you need to execute the command to complete the installation process:

```
sudo "/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui" --install
```

```

Output:
Linked: '/usr/local/bin/cmake' -> '/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake'
Linked: '/usr/local/bin/ctest' -> '/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/ctest'
Linked: '/usr/local/bin/cpack' -> '/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cpack'
Linked: '/usr/local/bin/cmake-gui' -> '/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui'
Linked: '/usr/local/bin/ccmake' -> '/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/ccmake'
```

Check that the installation is successful:

```
cmake --version
# cmake version 3.22.2
```
