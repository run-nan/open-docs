## When debugging the plugin locally, there is no start connection prompt

### Overview

When debugging locally, execute the `npx op invoke run` console to print **start connection!**, and there are no other prompts to print, which may be caused by incorrect binaries in your plugin project.

```bash
➜ npx op invoke run
  ✔ Validating command options
  ✔ Validating config/local.yaml fields
  ✔ Building plugin project Back-End dist files
  ✔ Initializing the plugin project front-end development server
  ✔ Initializing the node-host params
✔ Local debug parameters successfully initialized with target lifecycle: 'run'
Now starting dev server and node-host...
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Project is running at:
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Loopback: http://localhost:3000/
<i> [webpack-dev-server] On Your Network (IPv4): http://10.15.3.242:3000/
<i> [webpack-dev-server] On Your Network (IPv6): http://[fe80::1]:3000/
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Content not from webpack is served from '/Users/dev/ONES/open-platform/public' directory
Start the connection!
```

Normally, it will print as above to **Start the connection！**.

### Solution

1. The plugin project is copied from other operating systems of different CPU architectures (such as Windows to Mac). The copy contains node_modules files. When you use the command `npx op invoke run`, the plugin project will be compiled. Due to the different CPU architecture and the different binary files dependent on execution, the debugging process will be affected and no relevant plugin information will be returned.

2. If the plugin project is generated by an operating system with the same CPU architecture, use `ones envinfo` or node --> process.arch to check the node version of the compiled plugin project and see if the node version is the same on different development and debugging environments.

## When the plugin is debugged locally, the connection timeout is prompted.

### Overview

When debugging the plugin locally, the console shows that the connection timeout has been disconnected, and you need to check the status of the remote service.

### Solution

In the windows system, you can use the telnet command to listen to the URL corresponding to `platform.address` configured in the local.yaml in the plugin project.

```bash
telnet tcp://ip:port
```

In the Mac system, you can use the nc command to listen to the URL corresponding to `platform.address` configured in the local.yaml in the plugin project.

```bash
nc -vz -w 2 ip port
```

## After adding the frontend slot or backend capability, the capacity configuration is not hot updated.

### Overview

Each time a frontend slot or backend capability is added, the plugin.yaml file is modified. Whenever changes to plugin.yaml are involved, you need to clear the plugin information on the instance environment before reinstalling the plugin to the debugging environment. If the modification is `workspace/ plugin.sql`, you can also follow the solution below.

### Solution

1. Clear plugin information on the instance environment

```bash
npx op invoke clear
```

2. Reinstall the plugin to the debugging environment

```bash
npx op invoke run
```
