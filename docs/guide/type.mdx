# Plugin type

## Overview

ONES now supports 「single team」 and 「multi team」team management strategies, so the granularity of plugin is divided into 「team level plugin」and 「organization level plugin」.

### Team level plugin

It takes effect under the team under which it is installed.

### Organization level plugin

Plugins that are effective for all teams in the organization only need to be installed once under [Organization Management]-[Plugin Management] to take effect for each team.

### Other types

If you are careful, you may find that in addition to "Normal Plugin", there are also two parts: "Org Structure Syn, login and notification" and "Independent hosting service" under plugin management. so let's take a look at the difference between these two parts and normal functional plugins.

#### Org Structure Syn, login and notification

It is generally used to interface with third party account services.

#### Independent hosting service

Used to run instance level services. For example, replace the instance storage file service with a service of your own choice.
