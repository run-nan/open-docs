# Deploy

## Overview

During the initialization of the plugin project, ONES CLI initializes `git` for you in advance. We recommend that you use GitLab to host your engineering code and use GitLab CI/CD to build a continuous integration solution for your plugin project. So the following documentation tutorials are based on the `GitLab plugin continuous integration solution'.

## Usage

### Precondition

- The pipeline project has been configured on Gitlab.
- You have the maintainer or owner role of the project.

### Initialization

A plugin project initialized with ONES CLI generates two GitLab CI/CD related configurations. `.gitlab-ci.yml` and `config/ci-deploy.yaml`.

#### .gitlab-ci.yml

The preconfigured content of `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the plugin project will trigger the pipeline project provided by us, which will help you deploy the generated plugin package to the corresponding ONES instance environment. For the rest of the configuration, please refer to: [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://docs.gitlab.cn/jh/ci/yaml/gitlab_ci_yaml.html).

#### ci-deploy.yaml

The main function of the file `ci-deploy.yaml` is to **set the parameters required for GitLab pipelining to run**.

### Step 1: Connect ONES

Because the pipeline will help you deploy the generated plugin package to the corresponding ONES environment, you need to connect to ONES first. Execute the following command in the root directory of the plugin project:

```bash
npx op ci
```

There will be the following interactive questions and answers during the connection process:

```bash
Branch name: master
? Please enter the environment base URL: https://ones.cn
? Username: test@ones.cn
? Password: [hidden]
  ✔ Converting CI deployment params
  ✔ Validating CI deployment params
  ✔ Updating configuration into config/ci-deploy.yaml
✔ Successfully updated CI deployment configuration
Now you can commit your changes to the remote repository and deploy your project
? Do you want to execute 'npx op pickteam' for update team information into config file? (Y/n)
```

**Input parameter definition:**

- **branch name (master):** Select the name of the branch and select the default master.
- **base URL:** ONES address
- **username:** ONES user name
- **password:** ONES password

After the parameter input is completed and the verification is successful, you will be asked if you need to execute the `pickteam` command to select a team. Of course, you can also manually execute `pickteam` later to select a team.

:::caution notice
After executing `default`, you will need to enter a branchName, and then you can select `default`.
:::

After the above operations are completed, the op tool will write back some configurations to the `config/ci-deploy.yaml` file under the project. **do not modify the configuration manually**. The configuration is as follows:

```yaml title="ci-deploy.yaml"
default:
  host: https://ones.cn
  username: test@ones.cn
  password: test1234
  ones-check-id: 6vjJcr4L
  ones-check-point: team
  ones-plugin-id: JefbDHq5
  team_uuid: 6vjJcr4L
```

At this point, the connection ONES is complete.

### Step 2: Credential information desensitization

User credentials are stored in plaintext in the `/config/ci- deploy.yaml` file. When you do not want to store credentials in clear text, you can add user credentials to [CI/CD variable](https://gitlab.plugins.myones.net/help/ci/variables/index.md#add-a-cicd-variable-to-a-project).

Go to [Settings] of GitLab and select [CI/CD], then find [Variables] on the page to configure the credential information.

:::caution notice
The Key configured by Gitlab CI/CD Variable must be consistent with the configuration file
:::

Then replace the corresponding fields in `config/ci-deploy.yaml` in the plugin project, such as the username and password fields.

```yaml title="ci-deploy.yaml"
default:
  host: https://ones.cn
  username: ${username}
  password: ${password}
  ones-check-id: 6vjJcr4L
  ones-check-point: team
  ones-plugin-id: JefbDHq5
  team_uuid: 6vjJcr4L
```

### Step 3: Push code, trigger pipeline

Every time you push the code to the remote warehouse, the GitLab pipeline task will be triggered.

Go to "CI/CD" in GitLab and select "Pipelines" to see the pipelined task that has just been pushed and triggered. As shown below:

#### Step 4: Use plugin

After all the pipelining tasks are successful, you can find your plug-in in the corresponding ONES environment and use it happily.
