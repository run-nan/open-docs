# Overview

## What is the Open Platform

On the basis of the ONES system, the open platform abstracts the code framework and the corresponding tool set for secondary development, enabling developers to expand the capabilities of the ONES system at low cost and high efficiency to meet the customized needs of users.

## Open Platform Solutions

- (Subject) Bridging the contradiction between the productization of the core system and the individualization of user needs
- (Internal) Reduce the difficulty of development and improve development efficiency
- (External) Build a complete product ecological chain and encourage users to customize

## Features of Open Platform

- Low development cost
  - Based on `React` and `Node.js`, use a consistent language for front-end and back-end development and customization;
  - A large number of declarations are used to replace code development, which further reduces the learning cost and development threshold for developers;
- High development efficiency
  - Pay attention to developer experience, provide all-round developer support, and provide tools such as full-process development, debugging, and environment integration;
  - Support “what you see is what you get” local plugin development and debugging experience;
  - Provide "continuous integration" related infrastructure and tools to reduce development and test integration costs;
- Strong openness
  - Provide comprehensive secondary development capabilities based on existing system function modules;
  - Good abstraction of the capability model is carried out, which is easy to understand and at the same time satisfies in-depth customization;
