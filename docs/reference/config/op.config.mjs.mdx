# op.config.mjs

The CLI tool configuration file allows you to customize the behavior of certain commands in the [OP-CLI](../../tools/cli/op-cli.mdx) and [OPT-CLI](../../tools/cli/opt-cli.mdx) by using various configuration options.

You need to export a configuration object in `op.config.mjs`:

```js title="op.config.mjs"
/** @type { import("@ones/cli-utils").OpConfigSchema } */
export default {
  onesVersion: '3.15.0',
  scan: {
    apis: ['project/api/version'],
  },
}
```

The type definition for the configuration object is as follows:

```ts
interface OpConfigSchema {
  onesVersion?: string
  scan?: {
    roots?: string[]
    exclude?: Array<string | RegExp>
    output?: {
      level?: 'all' | 'matched'
    }
    patternFragment?: {
      pre?: string
      placeholder?: string
      post?: string
    }
    checkIsPathLikeString?: (value: string) => boolean
    apis?: string[]
  }
}
```

## onesVersion

The target ONES system version used for checking unsupported slots and abilities during packaging and scanning.

:::info
The difference between this field and the [service.min_system_version](./plugin.yaml.mdx#min_system_version) field in plugin.yaml is as follows:

- The `onesVersion` field in op.config.mjs needs to be manually assigned by the developer, whereas the `service.min_system_version` field in plugin.yaml is automatically deduced based on the capabilities used within the plugin. Developers do not need to modify the value of this field.
- After specifying the `onesVersion` in op.config.mjs, during the packaging of the OPK file, op-cli will validate whether the plugin uses deprecated capabilities before the target version and whether it uses capabilities that are only available after the target version. During plugin installation, the Open Platform will verify if the current ONES system version is greater than the `service.min_system_version` specified in the plugin's plugin.yaml file.

The default value is `all`.

### scan.apis

The collection of APIs to match. The default value is `[]`.

### scan.patternFragment

Configuration for URL regular expression fragments used to customize the matching rules.
