# Notes

A couple more notes to round it off.

## Catalog description

This directory archives all deprecated capability pack documentation, keeping only the relevant capability documentation descriptions for older plugins, which are no longer updated.

You should not use the capability packs in this directory when your new plugin meets the minimum requirements for using the new capability packs.

## Semver

The ability packages we provide follow the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) specification.

Until packages reaches a 1.0 release, breaking changes will be released with a new minor version. For example 0.5.1, and 0.5.4 will have the same API, but 0.6.0 will have breaking changes.
